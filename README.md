# parallel operation of power plant
solves the problems of parallel operation of power plants and draw graph incremental heat rate with load

This program is used for solving the parallel operation of problems of  3 power stations
first, you need to enter the capacity of the three stations
then, enter the input output relation of each station
finally,click on draw button
graph  between the incremental heat rate and load will appear 
if you want to know the load of each station at required total load, enter the required load then click on solve
